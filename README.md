# samplex
Package of useful sampling algorithms written in MLX


# To do:

- ~~Add convenient plotting tool~~
- ~~Add jumping factor with diagonal covariance matrix~~
- ~~Change structure to separate samplers from base samplex class~~
- Add a Bayesian example
- Treating parameters with different update speeds
- Add file of priors and include in target distribution
- Save chains every Nsave steps
- ~~Correct tqdm to accurately track progress~~
